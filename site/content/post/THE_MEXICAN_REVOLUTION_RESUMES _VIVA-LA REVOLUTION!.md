When Brexit happened on June 23, 2016, in the midst of the United State's Presidential Elections - I had a disturbing premonition that Donnie PeePee/PussyGrabber was to become the first rapist President of the United States of America.

With the Sunday, July 1 landslide victory of Mexican President-Elect Andreas Manuel Lopez Obrador, AMLO, I have this beautiful, powerful feeling in my chest, I have this beautiful anticipation that the people of the United States will soon have a similar victory over the dirty, stinking billionaires - the real enemies of us all.

>like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

AMLO is an old-school socialist like U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders. He was elected president of Mexico 12 years-ago. And then the billionaires, the power mafia, as he call them, robbed him of the presidency. He was elected president 6 years-ago. And the power mafia robbed him of the presidency, again.

And yet, on Sunday - the People prevailed.
