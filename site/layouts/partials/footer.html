					<li>Some people call me a poet....and that's all right, i've been called much worse. <BR><BR></li>
					<li>And yet, I'm not a poet. I don't do poetry. I do shock rhetoric. <BR><BR></li>
					<li>Perhaps history's greatest practioner of shock rhetoric is Rabbi Yeshua ben Yusef.<BR><BR></li>
					<li>"He who is without sin - cast the first stone....render on to Caesar the things of Caesar, 
					and on to God the things that are God's...evil things that are done in secret will be shouted 
					from the rooftops..."<BR><BR></li>
					<li>this is shock rhetoric. It is brutally honest, and yet artful no holds barred public 
					oratory/communications.  It is speaking truth close-up to the face of power. It is denouncing the master-of-this-world, 
					in shocking, no nonsense terms - it is shock rhetoric."</li>
