      text: "Perhaps history's greatest practioner of shock rhetoric is Rabbi Yeshua ben Yusef.

      text: "this is shock rhetoric. It is brutally honest, and yet artful no holds barred public oratory/communications. It is speaking truth close-up to the face of power. It is denouncing the master-of-this-world, in shocking, no nonsense terms - it is shock rhetoric."
